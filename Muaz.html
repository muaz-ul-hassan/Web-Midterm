							<h2>General Overview</h2>
							<p>Honestly, designing websites is hard, but that’s what makes all of the blood, sweat, and tears worth it. The reward of a beautiful, responsive masterpiece scrolling before your eyes and the fear of shifting your gaze away from the screen as to miss more seemingly magical animations and the flawless, responsive pages. As a developer located in Chicago, IL, I’ve had the honor to work for startup companies at 1871 and help create sites to propel businesses forward, turning their bold ideas into reality.</p>

							<p>But while these opportunities and experiences may seem impressive, I still have countless things to learn. And that’s where my past education at the Illinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA) along with my status as a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will help me succeed. Through IMSA, I’ve been able to challenge myself and learn with the best and brightest of Illinois to ultimately “advance the human condition.” For me, this meant sampling novel things, including Java courses and internship opportunities. Ultimately, this lead me to discover my love of computers and programming. Now, I aim to take this passion further as a computer science major at the University of Illinois.</p>

							<p>I had originally acquired my knowledge of web development and basic programming by self-teaching, and I was finally able to apply this knowledge in a real-world environment. Boy, was I excited. Nonetheless, I also have many other interests outside the languages of HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, etc., including Python, R, C++, game programming, and data analysis, just to name a few. And if you can’t find me working on cool projects in other languages or continuing to develop websites, you can probably find me breakdancing, sleeping, or just playing League of Legends (great game).</p>

							<p>Now that’s enough about me. I encourage you to snoop around the site or check out some of my other projects. And if you’re really interested, download my resume and don’t be afraid to reach out to me!</p>
